## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss on Monday morning.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

- A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
  - football (see sketches)

- The data structure you plan to use.
  - HTML, CSS, JQUERY

- How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  - Still uncertain about this...

- How you plan to approach this project.
  - Ideally, I'd like to get a general skeleton of my HTML all planned out so I have a structure to work with.
    Then I'll code the CSS for the appearance and some of the small things like hover effects.
    Next I plan on figuring out the javascript and ajax code, and tieing it to the code I've already created.

- 4-8 user stories for your game project.
  - As a player, I want the page to be very user friendly(simple) so that it isn't hard to navigate.
  - As a developer, I want my website to be responsive so that people can access it on the go.
  - As a player, I want the page to be attractive and inviting so that I don't get bored.
  - As a developer, I want the code to be as clean as possible so that another developer can easily read it
    and find their way around.

- How you plan to keep your code moodular.
  - Same as approach?

- What creative spin will you add to your project.
  - Football (see sketches)

- How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
  - Plan on saving with each new element added. (ie. committing)

- Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.
  - Negative. I would like to really nail down the basic requirements, and with time add some extra "fun"
    features if possible as well as create a very inviting appearance to the game.
